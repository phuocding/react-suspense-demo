# React Suspense Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses the Alpha version of React 16 (16.4.0-alpha.0911da3) so as to experiment with React Suspense.

You can view the demo [here](https://build-uzpsujvyrl.now.sh/) and read the accompanying article at [LogRocket's Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/async-rendering-in-react-with-suspense-5d0eaac886c8)
